"""EMG ML Engine - Machine Learning Pipeline for EMG Gesture Recognition

This package provides a complete machine learning pipeline for training,
optimizing, and deploying EMG gesture recognition models.

Example:
    Basic usage for training a gesture recognition model:

    >>> from emg_ml import DataLoader, ModelTrainer, FeatureExtractor
    >>>
    >>> # Load and preprocess data
    >>> loader = DataLoader("path/to/emg_data.csv")
    >>> data = loader.load_and_validate()
    >>>
    >>> # Extract features
    >>> extractor = FeatureExtractor(config="configs/features.yaml")
    >>> features = extractor.transform(data)
    >>>
    >>> # Train model
    >>> trainer = ModelTrainer(model_type="cnn_1d")
    >>> model = trainer.fit(features, labels)
    >>>
    >>> # Export for deployment
    >>> model.export_onnx("gesture_model.onnx")

The package is organized into several key modules:

- `data_ingestion`: Loading and validating EMG data from various sources
- `features`: Feature extraction and engineering pipelines
- `models`: ML model implementations and training frameworks
- `optimization`: Model optimization and export utilities
- `evaluation`: Model evaluation and validation tools

Configuration:
    All components use YAML configuration files for reproducible
    experiments. See the `configs/` directory for examples.

Safety:
    This package includes validation and safety checks appropriate
    for medical device applications. All models include confidence
    thresholds and fallback mechanisms.

class ModelTrainer:
    """Train machine learning models for EMG gesture recognition.

    The ModelTrainer provides a unified interface for training various
    types of models, from classical ML to deep learning approaches.

    Args:
        model_type: Type of model to train ('svm', 'cnn_1d', 'lstm', etc.)
        config_path: Path to model configuration file
        random_state: Random seed for reproducibility

    Attributes:
        model_type (str): The type of model being trained
        config (dict): Model configuration parameters
        is_fitted (bool): Whether the model has been trained

    Example:
        Train a CNN model with custom configuration:

        >>> trainer = ModelTrainer(
        ...     model_type="cnn_1d",
        ...     config_path="configs/cnn_config.yaml"
        ... )
        >>> model = trainer.fit(X_train, y_train)
        >>> accuracy = trainer.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
        >>> print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy:.3f}")

    Safety:
        The trainer includes automatic validation of training data
        and model outputs. Models failing safety checks will raise
        `ModelValidationError`.
